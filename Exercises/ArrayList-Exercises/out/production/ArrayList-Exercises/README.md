# ArrayList Exercises in Java

## Exercise 1: Basic Operations on ArrayList of Integers
1. Create an `ArrayList` of integers and:
   - Add 10 elements to the list.
   - Remove the third element.
   - Replace the first element with a new value.
   - Print the list after each operation.

## Exercise 2: Working with ArrayList of Strings
1. Create an `ArrayList` of strings representing fruits.
   - Check if `"Apple"` is in the list using `.contains()`.
   - Find the index of `"Banana"` in the list using `.indexOf()`.
   - If the fruit is found, print its index; otherwise, print `"Not found"`.

## Exercise 3: Filtering Odd Numbers
1. Create an `ArrayList` of integers.
   - Filter out all even numbers from the list (create a new list containing only odd numbers).
   - Print the new list of odd numbers.

## Exercise 4: Reversing an ArrayList
1. Create an `ArrayList` of integers.
   - Reverse the elements of the list without using the `.reverse()` method.
   - Print the reversed list.

## Exercise 5: Summing Elements in an ArrayList
1. Create an `ArrayList` of integers.
   - Find and print the sum of all the numbers in the list.

## Exercise 6: Removing Duplicates
1. Create an `ArrayList` with duplicate elements.
   - Write a method that removes all duplicates and returns a new list.
   - Print the new list with only unique values.

## Exercise 7: Sorting an ArrayList
1. Create an `ArrayList` of integers.
   - Sort the list in ascending order and print the sorted list.
   - Sort the list in descending order and print the result.

## Exercise 8: Finding Maximum Value
1. Create an `ArrayList` of integers.
   - Write a method to find and print the maximum value in the list.

## Exercise 9: Merging Two Lists
1. Create two `ArrayList`s of integers.
   - Merge the two lists into one.
   - Print the merged list.

## Exercise 10: Finding Common Elements in Two Lists
1. Create two `ArrayList`s of strings.
   - Find and print the common elements between the two lists.

## Exercise 11: Counting Occurrences of a String
1. Create an `ArrayList` of strings.
   - Count how many times a specific string (e.g., `"apple"`) appears in the list.

## Exercise 12: Summing with a Method
1. Create a method that takes an `ArrayList` of integers as a parameter and returns the sum of all the numbers.
   - Use an enhanced `for` loop.

## Exercise 13: Calculating Average
1. Create a method that will return the average of an `ArrayList` of integers.
   - Use the method from the previous exercise to get the sum first, then calculate the average.

## Exercise 14: Checking for Word in List
1. Create a method that takes two arguments: `String word`, `ArrayList<String>`.
   - The method should return a `boolean` indicating whether the word is in the `ArrayList`.
   
## Exercise 15: Counting Word Occurrences
1. Create a method that takes two arguments: `String word`, `ArrayList<String>`.
   - The method should return the number of times the word appears in the list.
